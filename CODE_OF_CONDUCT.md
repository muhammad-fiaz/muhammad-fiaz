# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Using inclusive language and avoiding offensive comments or personal attacks.
- Being mindful of your words and actions and their potential impact on others.
- Being open to constructive feedback and willing to learn from it.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome advances or attention.
- Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment, and any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
