i am spending my spare time building Apps and Web Skills for free because I want to help people get into apps and web development. My motivation comes from people finding Apps and  Web Skills useful, so if you like the project feel free to support me in any way you like! For example, you are more than welcome to become a stargazer, If you want to, it will absolutely make my day if you [support me with a cup of coffee]("https://www.patreon.com/fiaz")! <3
